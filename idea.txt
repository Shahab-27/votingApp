1. Vote Count per Candidate

Use $unwind + $group + $sort

Shows total votes each candidate received (leaderboard).

Example pipeline stages:

$unwind: "$votes" → flatten votes array

$group: { _id: "$votes.option", totalVotes: { $sum: 1 } }

$sort: { totalVotes: -1 }

2. Voters Who Haven’t Voted Yet

Use $lookup + $match

Shows voters who didn’t participate in a poll.

Steps:

$lookup → join voters with polls on votes.userId

$match → filter voters with empty votes

3. Most Active Voters

Use $unwind + $group + $sort + $limit

Shows top voters by number of votes cast.

Steps:

$unwind → flatten votes

$group → count votes per user

$sort → descending

$limit → top N users

4. Vote Percentage per Option

Use $unwind + $group + $project

Shows percentage distribution of votes for each option.

Steps:

$unwind → flatten votes

$group → total votes and option counts

$project → calculate percentage for each option

5. Multi-Poll Analytics (Advanced)

Combine multiple stages for enterprise-level reporting:

$match → filter active polls

$unwind → flatten votes

$group → count votes per option per poll

$lookup → join with candidates collection

$project → calculate percentages and top candidates

Useful for admin dashboards and analytics.

✅ Why This Stands Out

Avoids manual counting in code

Efficient for large datasets

Shows real-world backend skills for interviews

Enables analytics dashboards in your voting app

If you want, I can also draw a small diagram showing these aggregation pipelines visually — it makes it super easy to remember for notes and interviews.

Do you want me to do that?
